### Create Task
My create task idea is a recreation of the trending game "Wordle," where users have 6 attempts to guess one random five-letter word everyday. But I want to incorporate different themes or categories of words, and make it so users can play as many times as they want throughout the day. My code will meet Collegeboard's criteria by including the following:

1.  Instructions for input from the user, a device, an online data stream, OR a file
* Takes input from a user by asking them to try out different letters in order to figure out what the random word is
2.  At least one list to represent a collection of stored data
* List to generate random words that will be guessed by a user
* List to store the all of the letters attempted by a user
3.  At least one procedure that contributes to the program's intended purpose that defines procedure name, return type, AND one or more parameters
* Procedure to check if the word guessed by user has any correct letters/letter in the correct spot when compared to the actual word
* Procedure to  select a random word from the list for a user to guess
4.  An algorithm that includes, sequencing, selection, AND iteration
* Sequencing - The program needs to first generate the random word. Then it must take the input of a user. After it gets the inputs, it can use if statements to check the logic, and for loops to make it more efficient. If the user gets it in 6 or less tries, they win. If not, they lose.
* Selection - If Statements to check if the letters in the guessed word exist or match the letters in the real world
* Iteration -  For Loops to compare each individual letter entered by user (which will be stored in a list) against the letters of the correct word 
5.  Calls to your student-developed procedure
* The program could use an "on-click" call in the HTML portion in order trigger the procedure
* When the user inputs their word by clicking an "ENTER" button, it will call the procedure which compares each of the user's letters to the word's letter
6.  Instructions for output based on input and program functionality
* If the user wins, the program will display an output of a banner that says "Congratulations, you won!" with an upbeat sound effect.
* If the user loses, the program will display an output of a banner that says "Sorry, you lost." with a somber sound effect.
