* Crowdsourcing: reaching out beyond one community to obtain and share information, and participate in distributed computing
  * helps to reduce computer bias 
* Crowdsourcing is evident in Wikipedia, Crypto currency, and COVID data
* In CSP, we use crowdsourcing through
  * Rapid APIs - retrieves external data
  * Github - sharing and exchanging code with other Github users

<tr>
<td>CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?</td>
<td>
Digital empowerment allows people to reach their full potential in a networked society. People can empower themselves in the digital world by investing time into expanding their knowledge of technology. From then on, students can use their existing knowledge to participate in the digital world, and even continue building on it.

<tr>
<td>What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?</td>
<td>
Someone who is empowered in the digital world could help someone who is not by passing on their own knowledge to them. This could simply be done by answering any questions they might have, which is already tremendous guidance. However, something that could be done at greater level would be to start a club, at Del Norte for example, that is specifically dedicated to empowering people in the digital world.

The "paper/red tape" that is blocking digital empowerment is the digital divide, where not everyone has equal access to technology. These barriers can most often be seen in poorer places, and can be seen within Del Norte. Our high school encourages students to bring their own laptops/devices to school, but this may not be possible for some students.

<tr>
<td>Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing.</td>
<td> Computing is beneficial because it is more efficient, it is more accurate, and opens up a world of opportunities for people. However, it is harmful because it can become invasive, addicting, and distracting if used in the wrong ways.
</td>

<tr>
<td>Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?</td>
<td>
Dopamine is what allows people to feel pleasure. While it can be a positive experience for people, it can also have a negative impact on their mental and physical healths, as dopamine is addictive. For me, getting good grades is my source of dopamine that keeps me constantly feeling the need to do well in school. At times it can really affect my mental health, but when I get good grades, it is so worth it.
